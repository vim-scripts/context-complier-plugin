This complier plugin sets up texexec with appropriate options as the make program. To use this do

:compiler texexec
:make <options> <filename>

where <options> are additional options that you want to pass to texexec. If you always want to use this compiler with context files, add 

compiler texexec

in your .vim/ftplugin/context.vim file.
